# reviews-component
A reviews component built with React to push into Helix Forms

# Setup

To have the build and tests automatically verified on commit, run the following command to enable the pre-commit hook:

`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`

Note that if you already have hooks setup in your `.git/hooks` directory those will need to be moved to `./githooks`
